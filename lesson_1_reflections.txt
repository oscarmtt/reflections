How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It helped a lot

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I will get more experience on file changes, so I could anticipate some changes

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: you get to know what you are doing, in case there is a problem. Also, you have more flexibility
    Cons: more time consuming
	

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    I guess it revolves around the idea of a team working on one file on a more coordinated way, versus several people working on some file randomly

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    Git log allows me to see all the different commits, git diff allows me to compare two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Knowing there is a safe version of it gives more confidence at the time of making changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    Share code with other programmers
