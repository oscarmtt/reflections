When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When you want to share it with other people from different computers.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because if I got them automatically I could be flooded with tons of commits.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks: clone from github to github
Clones: clone from github to local OR clone from local to local
Branches: create an alternative/branch to your code


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

In case you cannot access to the online repository due to internet problems or getting into an airplane, for instance.
